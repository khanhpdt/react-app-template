# react-app-template

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It contains the following setups:

- TypeScript
- Bulma css
- redux
- redux-saga
- react-router
- axios

It also includes the HomeComponent as the starting point to implement your components.

The redux related things (e.g., store, state, sagas) are placed inside the `redux` folder.

## To start using this template

- Copy this folder to your target project folder

```bash
cp . -a target_folder/
```

- Make sure all needed files are copied. Check for the files with prefix "." (e.g., .eslintrs.js, .prettier.js, .gitignore)
- Remove .git folder
- Initialize new git repository in your target folder
